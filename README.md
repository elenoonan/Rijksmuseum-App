This application forms part of a continual assessment for the Advanced JavaScript module at IADT, Multimedia Computing, Year 4.

This application for My Rijksmuseum Collection has been developed using React, a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.   The purpose of the site is to offer users remote access to art collections of interest.

The data is sourced from the Rijksmuseum API website using an API key:
https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/api  

Using React Router, the application is designed to be a Single Page Application (SPA) where views are being swapped into the UI.  To the user, navigation will appear as though individual pages are being loaded.  

Instructions to run the application:
1.	Download the application from https://github.com/elenoonan/Rijksmuseum-App
2.	Go to your terminal emulator
3.	At the prompt, change directory to the application folder:
cd rijks-react-app
Press Enter
4.	At the prompt, run the application
	npm start
5.	The application will launch in your browser

Alternatively go to online hosting:
Firebase Hosting URL :
https://my-rijksmuseum-app.firebaseapp.com/

When the site loads, navigate to the different components using the traditional navigation bar.
